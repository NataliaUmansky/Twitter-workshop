Twitter's [Developer terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy) allow for up to 1,500,000 Tweet IDs or 50,000 public Tweets to be deposited online. Hence the materials (compare status_ids.rds and tweets.rds below) fallow these terms.

- /timelines.rds 
    
    - Includes the most recent 200 Tweets shared by Irish politicians listed in the [Politicians Ireland](https://twitter.com/i/lists/21722967) Twitter list
